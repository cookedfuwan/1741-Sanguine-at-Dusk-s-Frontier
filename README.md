This mod is made based on Project Alice a clone of victoria 2.

The idea for this mod is based on an alternate world where expansive ice sheets cover much of Manchuria, leading to a landscape dominated by vast lakes that stretch across the region. This unique geographical feature has had a profound impact on the politics and development of the area. The fertile soil around these lakes proved ideal for agriculture, giving rise to several early agricultural civilizations.

As these societies flourished, they shaped the political landscape of the region, leading to the emergence of powerful states and complex alliances. (Yes I do have a time line for most event starting from 700BC in this region but it's too long to type here.)

The protagonist

Amekosen (Heavenly Empire of the Pacific):
Amekosen, once a dominant empire from the Amenochi archipelago (Japan OTL) to Shirayukikaigan (Alaska OTL) and J≈çi Gohyaku Retto (Philippines OTL), is at a crossroads in 1740. After a period of decline and a brief subjugation by the Mongols, it regained independence and formed the Second Imperial Federation. In 1740, with tensions escalating due to Tengemokoku's aggressive policies and internal challenges, Amekosen must decide whether to confront its rival through war or use its economic strength to reassert dominance in the region.

Tengemokoku:
Emerging from a powerful revolt, Tengemokoku has united the Mongolian tribes and is now openly defying the peace accords with Amekosen. In 1740, under a bold new leader, the nation supports uprisings against Amekosen and seeks to expand its influence across the Shayu region. Tengemokoku is at a turning point, ready to challenge the old order and assert its power through military and diplomatic means.

Koyuaki:
Koyuaki, a prosperous city-state born from a fishing village, now thrives as a major trading hub. However, it faces strategic dilemmas as Amekosen's navy gains access to nearby waters and Tengemokoku modernizes its military. In 1740, Koyuaki must navigate these growing threats by deciding whether to ally with one of the regional powers or strengthen its own defenses to maintain independence and economic stability.

Amekoseito:
Amekoseito, a highly autonomous urban state and a center for intellectual freedom, finds itself in a precarious position in 1740. As tensions rise with Amekosen, which considers imposing a blockade to curb its influence, Amekoseito must choose between cooperating with the empire or pursuing its own path to protect its status as a refuge for free thinkers and a hub for global trade.

Hyoutoukoku:
Hyoutoukoku, an independent nation in northern Fowau (Canada OTL), balances between its colonial past and its current role as a resource-rich and strategically located state. In 1740, it navigates the challenges of maintaining independence while developing its economy and managing relations with indigenous populations and neighboring powers.

Anzato:
Anzato, having gained independence from Amekosen in 1682, is now a young nation in the southern Fowau continent (USA OTL). In 1740, it faces the dual challenge of building a new identity and managing the legacy of its colonial past, while also dealing with potential threats and opportunities from its neighbors and the evolving geopolitical landscape.

Towaen:
Towaen remains under Amekosen control as a colonial outpost in Honohaji (South America OTL). In 1740, it represents the colonial ambitions of Amekosen, grappling with local resistance and the complexities of administering a distant territory rich in resources but fraught with challenges.

Minaminokuni:
Minaminokuni, an Amekosen colony in Menzu (Oceania OTL), continues to serve as a strategic point for expansion and trade. In 1740, it faces the task of balancing colonial governance with the opportunities and tensions presented by its remote location and the diverse cultures within its borders.
